# LeetHub

## How It Works
LeetHub monitors your LeetCode submissions. When you successfully solve a problem, it automatically commits and pushes the solution to a GitHub repo names 'LeetCode-Questions'. If it doesn't exist, it creates it for you. The directory stores files with question names and numbers (eg. 1-TwoSum). Inside those files are the answer.txt and question.txt.
